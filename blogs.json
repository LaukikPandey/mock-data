Though 2022 might have had its fair share of hiccups, it set the stage for exhilarating new beginnings. Imagine seizing the gift of 19 long weekends that lay ahead of us, shaping them into exhilarating mini-escapes to rekindle your spirit. Now, the only question that remains is - where to first? Allow us to guide you on a journey from the tranquil lakes of Ladakh to the mystical floating islands of Assam, destinations where wonder meets the soul.</h6></br></br><p><span>Maharashtra&#39;s Sindhudurg</span></p></br></br><p>The gateway to paradise just got closer! Sindhudurg&#39;s spanking new Chipi Airport has flung its doors open, trimming the journey between this charming coastal haven and the pulsating heart of Mumbai to less than two hours. Picture yourself plunging into the crystal waters off the Tarkarli coast, stepping back in time at the historic Sindhudurg Fort in Malvan, or scaling the 1800s lighthouse near the picturesque Vengurla Rocks. And if you&#39;re craving some Goan vibes, the alluring north Goa coastline is just a brief drive away. The adventure of a lifetime awaits!</p></br></br><img src='https://storage.googleapis.com/flyzyzero-public/groupzy_taj.png'>\n</br></br><p>Sikkim, the North&rsquo;s Jewel</p></br></br><p>In April, the Yumthang Valley transforms into a painter&#39;s dream canvas, especially in the vibrant heart of Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary. Imagine being surrounded by a symphony of over 40 varieties of rhododendrons, each blossoming in radiant hues of crimson that dance playfully in every corner you glance.<br />On the flip side, venture to the exhilarating heights of Zero Point in Sikkim, the state&#39;s pinnacle of motorable roads. Here, a pristine white canvas awaits, as the region dons a thick blanket of snow, offering a tranquil contrast to the colorful valley below. Experience the best of both worlds, in one magical destination!West Bengal&#39;s Darjeeling</p></br><p>Darjeeling&#39;s high mountains and meandering tiny streets give way to enormous tea estates. The season for planting here, which lasts from March to October, is also when the scent of the bushes permeates the entire hill station. If you&#39;re fortunate, you could get to see the Makaibari estate harvest Oolong, which is only done on the first full moon night of the season.</p></br></br><p>Ladakh&rsquo;s Tso Moriri Lake</p></br></br><p>No less captivating than the towering mountain sides it contrasts is the lake&#39;s vivid blue hue. The greatest high-altitude lake in India, Tso Moriri, is less well-known than Pangong Lake. You will be drawn to the region by its breathtaking scenery, which includes wide-open spaces and bright sky, as well as uncommon fauna like migrating birds and Tibetan wolves as well as more common creatures that are managed by the changpas in the area.</p></br></br><p>Kerala&#39;s Gavi</p></br></br><p>The pristine beauty of Gavi is enhanced by mild temperatures and luxuriant foliage in July. Wild animals like the sambar and barking deer may be seen in this Malabar town&#39;s lush woodlands. The remainder of the property is covered with vineyards where you can learn about making wine and magnificent waterfalls where you can cool yourself.</p></br></br><p>Tamil Nadu&#39;s Yercaud</p></br></br><p>If you&#39;ve already visited the well-known plantation towns in south India, this year, make your way to Yercaud&#39;s bamboo woods, one of the top destinations in all of India. The little village, which is situated at the base of Salem, offers many vantage points looking out over the valley as well. To reach Kiliyur Falls, you must descend a slope. For its unspoiled beauty and serene environment, the Yercaud lake is a must-see.</p></br></br><p>Assam&#39;s Majuli</p></br></br><p>Majuli island, which is located between two Brahmaputra canals, is flooded for most of the year. The Assamese agricultural population returns to the land when the monsoons fade, revealing the region&#39;s sparkling beaches. Fast-changing weather patterns and frequent flash floods from local streams are predicted to permanently shut down the region in the upcoming years, so get to this peaceful location soon.</p></br></br>",

Longtail boats lying on white sand, limestone cliffs rising above a turquoise sea, and dazzling temples sticking out of a lush green forest are some sights you&#39;ll see in this region. You may immediately book a trip to Thailand after seeing these views. However, you might be unsure about what to do in Thailand once you arrive. How can you make the most of your time now that you&#39;ve arrived in this lovely nation in Southeast Asia? Thailand offers a vast variety of unique activities for all kinds of tourists. For thrill-seekers, rock climbing and cliff jumping; for spiritual seekers, there are meditation retreats and temple tours; for foodies, there are culinary lessons and night markets; and for ocean lovers, there is scuba diving and sea kayaking.</h6></br></br><p><span>Diving in the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea</span></p></br></br><p>A magnificent world of marine life exists beneath the warm, turquoise waters of the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. You can view everything up close while scuba diving in Thailand, from exotic fish to colourful coral reefs to other marine life like turtles, sharks, and rays. The Thai islands of Koh Tao, Koh Phi Phi, Koh Samui, Koh Yao Noi, and Koh Lipe are among the top locations for scuba diving. Consider taking a liveaboard if you are an experienced diver looking for a really unique experience. Thailand is one of the loveliest and most economical destinations to do such a dive.</p></br></br><img src='https://storage.googleapis.com/flyzyzero-public/groupzy_blog2_img.png'>\n</br></br><p>Explore all the islands!</p></br></br><p>Over 17,000 islands can be found in the South of Thailand, and it would be a waste not to visit at least a few of them. Large islands like Koh Samui and Phuket have their own airports, making getting to them from the mainland simple. Travel even further afield to see some of the untamed tropical nature of Thailand&#39;s smaller islands. In the water, you could come across little local settlements, coral reefs, limestone cliffs, monkeys, coconut palm trees, lovely bays, and other undiscovered wonders. You may either take an island-hopping trip or set out on your own in local boats, but either way, you are guaranteed to see some breathtaking scenery.</p></br></br><p>Enjoy the White Temple</p></br></br><p>Thailand is home to many magnificent temples, but the White Temple in Chiang Rai is unquestionably one of the most striking. This gorgeous Buddhist monastery, known as Wat Rong Khun in Thai, is decorated with fantastic craftsmanship which is completely painted white. The stunning location for photography is enhanced by the sight of the intriguing edifice reflecting in the nearby pools.</p></br></br><p>Visit a night market</p></br></br><p>A night market is among the top things to do in Thailand. Numerous cities around the nation have their own night markets where you may find bargain trinkets, savour delectable street cuisine, and take in local entertainment. Even though there are several night markets around Thailand, Chiang Mai&#39;s Sunday strolling street market is one of the biggest and most remarkable.</p></br></br><p>Watch a bout of Muay Thai boxing</p></br></br><p>Muay Thai Boxing, a thrilling, fast-paced combat sport, is the national sport of Thailand. Buy a ticket, get a drink, and settle down to watch the swift and skilled local athletes square off in the ring; nightly boxing contests are held in most major cities nationwide. You may even enroll in Muay Thai classes to learn the fundamentals from a qualified instructor in order to fully immerse yourself in Thai culture.</p></br></br>",
